Linux Commands:
1.      pwd — When you first open the terminal, you are in the home directory of your user. To know which directory you are in, you can use the “pwd” command.
 
2.  	 ls —ls command to know what files are in the directory you are in. You can see all the hidden files by using the command “ls -a”.
 
3.  	 cd — cd command to go to a directory. For example, if you are in the home folder, and you want to go to the downloads folder, then you can type in “cd Downloads”.
 
4.  	 mkdir & rmdir — mkdir command when you need to create a folder or a directory. For example, if you want to make a directory called “DIY”, then you can type “mkdir DIY”.
 
5.  	 rm — Use the rm command to delete files and directories.  Use "rm -r" to delete just the directory. It deletes both the folder and the files it contains when using only the rm command.
